* **/&lt;transactionalAPI&gt;**: interact with the transactional messages API (the name of the transactional messages API endpoint depends on your instance configuration). For more on this, refer to [this section](managing-transactional-messages.md).
* **/workflow/execution**: interact with workflows. For more on this, refer to [this section](controlling-a-workflow.md).

By default, the main resources available for the **profileAndServices** and **profileAndServicesExt** APIs are:
