# Assign your brand {#branding-assign}

## Assigning a brand to an email {#assigning-a-brand-to-an-email}

## Linking a brand to a template {#linking-a-brand-to-a-template}

To use the parameters defined for a brand, it must be linked to a delivery template or landing page template. To do this, you have to create or edit a template.

>For more information about creating a template, refer to the [Creating a template](../../start/using/marketing-activity-templates.md) section.

Once your template has been created, you can link it to a brand. To do this:

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Edit properties]** button to access the template properties.
