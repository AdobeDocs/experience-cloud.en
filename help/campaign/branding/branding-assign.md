## Link a brand to a template {#linking-a-brand-to-a-template}

To use the parameters defined for a brand, it must be linked to a delivery template. To do this, you have to create or edit a template.

Your template will be linked to the brand. In the email editor, the elements such as the **Email address of default sender**, the **Default sender name**, or the **Logo** will use the configured brand data.
