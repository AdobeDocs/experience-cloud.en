# About Branding {#branding-gs}

>[!IMPORTANT]

>Brands cannot be created or modified by end-users: these operations have to be performed by Adobe Campaign technical administrator. For any request, contact Adobe Customer care.

>Multi-branding cannot be used in the context of transactional messaging. For more on this, see [Transactional messages and branding](../../channels/using/transactional-messaging-limitations.md#permissions-and-branding).

Every company has brand visual and technical guidelines. With Adobe Campaign, you can define a set of specification to present a consistent brand to your customers, from logos to technical aspects, such as email sender, URL or domains.

Technical administrators can define one or several brands to centrally enter the parameters that affect a brand's identity. This includes the brand logo, the domain of the landing pages' access URL, or message tracking settings. With Adobe Campaign, you can create these brands and link them to messages or landing pages. This configuration is managed in templates.

The main principle of configuring and using brands is to:

1. Create and configure the brand - this operation requires specific permissions and is carried out by the Adobe Campaign technical administrator. Steps to get a new brand in Campaign are detailed [in this section](#creating-a-brand).
1. Create one or several delivery and landing page templates for this brand. Refer to the [Creating a template](../../start/using/marketing-activity-templates.md) section.
1. Create messages and landing pages based on this template. Refer to the [Creating an email](../../channels/using/creating-an-email.md) and [Creating a landing page](../../channels/using/designing-a-landing-page.md) sections.
