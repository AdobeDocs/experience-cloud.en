# Creating a profile dimension{#creating-a-custom-profile-dimension}

Reports can also be created and managed based on profile data created during the recipient schema extension.

* [Step 1: Extend your recipient schema](##extend-schema)
* [Step 2: Link your new custom field](#link-custom)
* [Step 3: Create a dynamic report to filter recipients with the profile dimension](#create-report)

## Step 1: Extend your recipient schema {#extend-schema}

To add a new profile field, you need to extend your schema, follow the steps below:

1. Navigate to the **[!UICONTROL Administration]** > **[!UICONTROL Configuration]** > **[!UICONTROL Data schemas]** folder in the Explorer.

1. Identify your custom recipient schema and select it. If you have not yet extended the built-in nms:recipient schema, refer to [this procedure](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/campaign/campaign-v8/developer/shemas-forms/extend-schema).

1. Add your custom field to the schema editor.

   For example, to add a Loyalty custom field in your recipient schema: 

   ```
   <attribute label="Loyalty" name="loyalty" type="string"/>
   ```

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

1. Then, identify your custom broadLogRcp schema and select it. If you have not yet extended the built-in Delivery log schema, refer to [this procedure](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/campaign/campaign-v8/developer/shemas-forms/extend-schema).

1. Add the same custom field as your Recipient schema to the schema editor.

Your new profile field is now ready to be used and selected by your recipients.

## Step 2: Link your new custom field {#link-custom}

>[!NOTE]
>
> You can only add up to 20 custom field to Dynamic report.

Now that your profile field is created, we need to link it to the corresponding Dynamic reporting dimension.

Before extending the log with our profile field, make sure that the PII window was accepted to be able to send PII data to dynamic report. For more on this, refer to this [page](pii-agreement.md).

1. Navigate to the **[!UICONTROL Administration]** > **[!UICONTROL Configuration]** > **[!UICONTROL Data schemas]** > **[!UICONTROL Additional reporting field]** folder in the Explorer.

   ![](assets/custom_field_5.png)

1. Click **[!UICONTROL New]** to create your corresponding Dynamic reporting dimension.

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Edit expression]** and browse through the Recipient schema to find your previously created profile field.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Finish]**.

1. Type-in your dimension **[!UICONTROL Label]**, visible in Dynamic reporting, and click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

Your profile field is now available as a profile dimension in your reports. To delete your profile dimension, you can select it and click the **[!UICONTROL Delete]** icon. 

Now that recipient schema has been extended with this profile field and your custom dimension created, you can start targeting recipients in deliveries.

## Step 3: Create a dynamic report to filter recipients with the profile dimension {#create-report}

After sending your delivery, you can breakdown reports using your profile dimension.

1. From the **[!UICONTROL Reports]** tab, select an out-of-the-box report or click the **[!UICONTROL Create]** button to start one from scratch.

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Dimensions]** category, click **[!UICONTROL Profile]** then drag and drop your profile dimension to your freeform table.
