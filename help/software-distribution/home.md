## Introduction

As of June 2020, the Experience Cloud solution [!UICONTROL Software Distribution] page replaces the download platform's [!UICONTROL PackageShare] for AEM and [!DNL Neolane] for [!DNL Campaign]. It provides a more efficient experience to find and download your software. An intuitive user interface, a simplified search and a greatly improved download speed make downloading software packages for Experience Cloud products a great user experience. Approved software packages from Adobe and packages from partner companies are now available for the following products:

1. **Adobe Experience Manager** - Everything related to Service and Maintenance, Security, Tooling and more - for all supported AEM versions.
1. **Adobe Experience Manager as a [!UICONTROL Cloud Service]** - [!UICONTROL AEM Cloud SDK], [!UICONTROL AEM Cloud] migration tools and more.
1. **Adobe Campaign** - All current [!DNL Campaign] installer versions and related tools.
1. **General** - General purpose tooling including [!DNL Oracle] JDKs for Adobe customers.

## Navigation

### Select your product

You can choose software downloads from the products that your organization has licensed. The header menu in [!UICONTROL Software Distribution] shows these products including the **General** start page where you can find general-purpose software downloads. Select the product for which you want to download software.

### Find your download

Once you are on a product download page of your choice, you will see all product-related downloads listed on that page. The list of downloads might be too long to find your download on first glance. Thatâ€™s why [!UICONTROL Software Distribution] offers you simple, but powerful ways to find your download. In most cases, you will find it convenient to use the search filters on the left-hand side to filter the list of downloads to what is relevant to you. Depending on the product, you will find filters like version, solution or software type.

Another search option is the free-text search on the top right-hand side.

Being part of the Experience Cloud solutions family, [!UICONTROL Software Distribution] allows you to navigate in your Experience Cloud solutions context and to make use of unified Experience Cloud services, including core services, personalized notifications, and much more.

### Download software

By double-clicking a displayed software download, a dialog opens and provides you with more information. For example, you can see a description, the provider name, and EULA, which you need to accept before you can proceed further with your download.

You can also share a link to that particular download. Click the **Share** button to copy the URL.
