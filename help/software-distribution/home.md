1. **Adobe Experience Manager** - Everything related to Service and Maintenance, Security, Tooling and more - for all supported AEM versions.
1. **Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service** - AEM Cloud SDK, AEM Cloud migration tools and more.
1. **Adobe Campaign** - All current Campaign installer versions and related tools.
1. **General** - General purpose tooling including Oracle JDK’s for Adobe customers

## Navigation

### Select your product

You can choose software downloads from the products that your organization has licensed. The header menu in Software Distribution is showing these products including the start page 'General' where you can find software downloads for general purpose. Select the product for which you want to download software.

### Find your download

Once you are on a product download page of your choice, you will see all product related downloads listed on the page. The list of downloads might be too long to find your download on the first sight. That’s why Software Distribution offers you simple, but powerful ways to find your download. In most cases, you will find it convenient to use the search filters on the left side to filter the list of downloads to what is relevant to you. Depending on the product, you will find filters like version, solution or software type.
Another search option is the free-text search on the top right.

Being part of the Experience Cloud solutions family, Software Distribution allows you to navigate in your Experience Cloud solutions context and to make use of unified Experience Cloud services including core services, personalized notifications and much more.

### Downloading Software

By double-clicking a listed software download, a dialog opens and provides you with more information. For instance, you will be able to see a description, the provider name and the EULA, which you need to accept before you can proceed further with your download by clicking the Download button.
You can also share a link to that particular download, the URL is copied for further use by clicking the Share button.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Software distribution supports browser downloads only. When using AEM Package Manager for new installations, it is recommended to download the package to a local folder and install the package from there.

Software distribution was built with AEM components and is powered by Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service.
