# Adobe Deliverability Services {#deliv-home}

Deliverability Consultants and Operations teams have to perform multiple activities to help customers improve their email deliverability. After analysis of all deliverability functions, it is found that while the most capabilities can be made accessible to customers directly, some capabilities should be restricted to the Adobe deliverability team only. In order to provide faster & better deliverability services to customers, we have decided to create a UI-based deliverability application which will serve as a single-stop solution for the Deliverability team. Using this application, the Deliverability team will be able to provide their services to the customers of multiple products in the Customer Journey Management family i.e. Journey Optimizer, Campaign and Marketo.

The following feature is currently available:

**Global Suppression List** â€“ This feature is not to be exposed to the customers, neither for viewing nor for any updates. However, the list needs to be continuously monitored and updated both manually (by the Deliverability team) and automatically (by athird-party vendor: Blackbox) .
