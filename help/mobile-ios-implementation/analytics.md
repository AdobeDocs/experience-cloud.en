# Add Adobe Analytics

In this lesson, you will implement the [Adobe Analytics extension](https://docs.adobelaunch.com/extension-reference/web/adobe-analytics-extension) and create rules to send data to Adobe Analytics.

[Adobe Analytics](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/reference/) is an industry-leading solution that empowers you to understand your customers as people and steer your business with customer intelligence.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

1. Add Adobe Analytics to your Mobile App

There are many things that could be implemented for Analytics in Launch. This lesson is not exhaustive, but should give you a solid overview of the main techniques you will need for implementing in your own site.

## Prerequisites

You should have already completed the lessons in the [Configure Launch](launch-create-a-property.md) section.

Additionally, you will need at least one report suite ID and your tracking server. If you don't have a test/dev report suite that you can use for this tutorial, please create one. If you are unsure how to do that, see [the documentation](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/reference/new_report_suite.html). You can retrieve your tracking server from your current implementation, Adobe Consultant or Customer Care representative.

## Steps

Nice work! You have completed the Analytics section. Of course, there are many other things that you can do to enhance our Analytics implementation, but hopefully this has given you some of the core skills you will need to tackle the rest of your needs.
