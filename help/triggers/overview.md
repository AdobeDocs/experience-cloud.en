# Triggers Overview {#}

You can use triggers in real-time decisions and personalization. For example:

* Configure fast re-marketing for cart abandons or cart abandons with products removed
* Incomplete forms and applications
* Any actions or sequence of actions on site

## Types of Triggers

Generally, a trigger can take 15-90 minutes to launch a marketing campaign. This delay varies depending on the implementation of data collection, load on the pipeline, custom configuration of the defined trigger, and the workflow in Adobe Campaign.

* **Abandonment:** You can create a trigger to fire when a visitor views a product but does not add anything to the cart.
* **Action:** You can create triggers, for example, to fire after newsletter sign-ups, email subscriptions, or applications for credit cards (confirmations). If you are a retailer, you can create a trigger for a visitor who signs up for a loyalty program. In media and entertainment, create triggers for visitors who watch a certain show, and perhaps you want to respond with a survey.
* **Session Start and Session End:** Create a trigger for session start and session end events.
