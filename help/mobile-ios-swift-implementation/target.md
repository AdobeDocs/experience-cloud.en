# Add Adobe Target

In the previous lesson, you enabled and used Adobe Target's visual experience composer (VEC) for mobile apps. The Mobile VEC allows you to modify text and images in A/B tests and Experience Targeting activities, without requiring app updates after the initial implementation.

As your personalization program matures, you will want to start getting into advanced personalization use cases such as modifying functionality in your application. The Adobe Target extension allows you to grow your personalization capabilities to alter virtually any aspect of your mobile applications, such as links, rolling out new features, layout testing and user flows. The Target extension also supports Target Premium features such as Recommendations, Automated Personalization, and Auto Target activities.

Adobe Target lessons will be added eventually to this tutorial. Until then, please see the [Target mobile documentation](https://aep-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/using-mobile-extensions/adobe-target) for more details.
