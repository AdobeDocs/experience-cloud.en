# Publish your Launch Property

Now that you have implemented some key solutions of the Adobe Experience Cloud in your Development environment, it's time to learn the publishing workflow.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

1. Publish a Development library to the Staging environment
1. Map a Staging library to your production website using the Debugger
1. Publish a Staging library to the Production environment

## Publish to Staging

 Now that you have created and validated your library in the Development environment, it is time to publish it to Staging.

1. Go to the **[!UICONTROL Publishing]** page

1. Open the dropdown next to your library and select **[!UICONTROL Submit for Approval]**

   ![Click Submit in the Modal](images/mobile-publishing-submit.png)

1. Once the green-dot icon appears, the library can be previewed in the Staging environment.

In a real-life scenario, the next step in the process would typically be to have your QA team validate the changes in the Staging library. They can do this using the Debugger.

**To Validate the Changes in the Staging Library**

1. In your Launch property, open the [!UICONTROL Environments] page

1. In the [!UICONTROL Staging] row, click the Install icon

   ![Install icon](images/mobile-launch-installIcon.png) to open the modal
   ![Go to the Environments page and click to open the modal](images/mobile-publishing-getStagingCode.png)

In real-life, once your QA team has signed off by reviewing the changes in the Staging environment it is time to publish to production.

## Publish to Production

1. Go to the [!UICONTROL Publishing] page

1. From the dropdown, click **[!UICONTROL Approve for Publishing]**:

   ![Approve for Publishing](images/mobile-publishing-approveForPublishing.png)

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Approve]** button in the dialog box:

   ![Click Approve](images/mobile-publishing-approve.png)

1. The library will now appear in the [!UICONTROL Approved] column in the unbuilt state (yellow dot):

1. Open the dropdown and select **[!UICONTROL **Build and Publish to Production]**:

   ![Click Build &amp; Publish to Production](images/mobile-publishing-buildAndPublishToProduction.png)

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Publish]** in the dialog box:

   ![Click Publish](images/mobile-publishing-publish.png)

1. The library will now appear in the [!UICONTROL Published] column:
