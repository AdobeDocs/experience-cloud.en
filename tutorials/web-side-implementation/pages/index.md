# Overview

_Implementing the Adobe Experience Cloud with Launch, by Adobe_ is the perfect starting point for front-end developers or technical marketers who want to learn how to implement the Adobe Experience Cloud solutions on their web site.

Each lesson contains how-to exercises and foundational information to help you implement the Experience Cloud and understand its value.  Callouts are provided to highlight information which might be useful to customers migrating from our older tag manager--Dynamic Tag Management. Demo sites are provided for you to complete the tutorial, so you can learn the underlying techniques in a safe environment. After completing this tutorial, you should be comfortable implementing these solutions as well as non-Adobe marketing tags on your own website.

After completing this you will be able to:

* Create a Launch Property
* Install a Launch Property on a website
* Add the Adobe Experience Cloud solution extensions, including:
  * **Adobe Analytics**
  * **Adobe Target**
  * **Adobe Audience Manager**
  * **Experience Cloud ID Service**

* Create rules and data elements to send data to the Adobe solutions
* Validate the implementation
* Publish changes in Launch through development, staging, and production environments

## Prerequisites

In these lessons, it is assumed that you have an Adobe Id and the required permissions in order to complete the excercises. If not, you may need to reach out to your Experience Cloud Administrator to request access.

* In Launch, you must have permission to Develop, Approve, Publish, Manage Extensions, and Manage Environments
* In Target,
* In Audience Manager,
* In Analytics,

Also, it is assumed that you are familiar with front-end development languages like HTML and JavaScript. You do not need to be a master of these languages to complete the lessons, but you will get more out of them if you can comfortably read and understand code.
